            <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
            <p>It is important that all groups and organizers affiliated with the Animal 
            Save Movement group follow these guiding principles and operate under a 
            code of conduct as set out below.</p>
            <ol class="font16">
                <li>
                    <span>Create a welcoming, peaceful and safe environment for all those who attend. Respect 
                    other vigil attendees. We all share a common goal. Refrain from any violent, loud or 
                    threatening behaviour either verbal or physical towards workers, security, police or 
                    members of the public.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Do not engage in personal feuds or conflicts on site or on social media. 
                    Avoid being overly critical of approaches taken by other animal rights 
                    organizations; different styles of activism have their place in a diverse 
                    movement.</span> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Offer compassion and support to anyone in the group experiencing trauma or being 
                    emotionally overwhelmed at a vigil or event.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Do not increase the anxiety or stress to the animals to whom we bear witness. 
                    Approach them slowly with love and respect. </span>  
                </li>
                <ul class="squares font16">
                    <li>
                        <span>Stay Calm: Animals are very sensitive to our energy. Approach the truck slowly, 
                        calmly and quietly so as not to frighten animals more than they are already.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Noise: Animals are extremely sensitive to noise and under a great deal of stress. 
                        Minimize loud noises (e.g., do not use megaphones in close proximity to the animals) or 
                        shouting.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Water: Offer water to the animals. Do not spray or throw water at them or in the 
                        truck. If they do not accept your offer then stop.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Touching: Exercise discretion when engaging with and touching the animals; don't 
                        scare them.</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <span>Be safe</span>  
                </li>
                <ul class="squares font16">
                    <li>
                        <span>We encourage all attendees to wear reflective vests.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Listen to and respect the instructions of safety marshals who are there to 
                        ensure the safety of attendees.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>At all times be mindful to keep a safe distance from the trucks when they are 
                        in motion, especially when they are turning.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Approach the truck when safety marshals signal that it's safe.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Bear witness on curb side of truck, not on traffic side.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Do not put arms in trucks. If a truck moves or animals panic, you can be 
                        seriously injured.</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <span>Speak to drivers, employees, and police with respect. Resist temptation to react 
                    to provocations from employees. Oppose anger and violence with love and kindness.</span>  
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Public Outreach: Stay peaceful and positive. Avoid temptation to respond to 
                    negative comments with negative responses.</span>  
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>When not bearing witness, hold a sign at the road or hand out leaflets. If you 
                    choose not to, please go to the designated break area so as not to detract from the 
                    seriousness of our message.</span>  
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>ASM affiliated events must be alcohol and drug free.</span>  
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Be mindful we are engaging in a nonviolent struggle to win animal rights 
                    campaigns and to build community. We take an intersectional stance and build coalitions 
                    with environmental, anti-racist, and other social justice groups.</span>  
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Above all, stay safe, stay mindful, and stay committed to those who need us to hear their voice.</p>
            <p>Non compliance of the above or disrespectful behaviour of any kind will not be tolerated and we may 
            ask individuals persistently violating the principles to leave the vigil. If you feel someone is not 
            adhering to these guidelines, please inform a marshal or email humanresources@animalsavemovement.org</p>

            <h1>MOU for Chapter Organizers</h1>
            <p>Animal Save Movement operates under a grassroots love based community organising approach. No one 
            person is in charge as in a hierarchy, rather we have a team of leaders. Every action we take is on 
            behalf of the animals and building an animal rights community. Be mindful that during all interactions, 
            on social media, email and in person you are a representative of ASM.</p>
            <p><b>ASM organizers and activists must adhere to the following:</b></p>
            <ol class="font16">
                <li>We advocate veganism and animal rights as an imperative. We do however address animal welfare 
                    if violations are spotted. Please report any incidents to the appropriate agency in order to 
                    put a spotlight on the industry.
                </li>
                <li>Welcome and encourage members expressing a desire to take a more active role and nurture 
                    leadership in others. Work as a team, make collective decisions, and listen to and consider 
                    all points of view.
                </li>
                <li>Refrain from posting inflammatory content on social media. Avoid criticizing other groups for 
                    their approach, e.g., PETA, Mercy For Animals etc. Different styles of activism have a place and 
                    may be effective to different audiences. Avoid negative comments about any individual or group, 
                    rather act as a positive role model.
                </li>
                <li>Be mindful of our love based approach at all times. Do not use offensive or hateful adjectives 
                    when corresponding with others. Respond to negativity with positivity, love for hate.

                </li>
                <li>Set aside any personal differences and do not engage in personal feuds or conflicts with other 
                    organizers, activists or members of the public in any way, including in person or on social media. 
                    We want the Animal Save Movement to be a unifying and mobilizing force.
                </li>
                <li>If you are unable to resolve personal or organizational differences, in the first instance speak 
                    directly to the individual involved, ask your CL and RLs for assistance or if it’s an organizational 
                    issue contact HR who will be able to offer advice and support. Do not bypass the person you are 
                    having the conflict with by involving other organizers.
                </li>
                <li>Make vigils public, not private, events to encourage as many people as possible to attend. Create 
                    Facebook events under the relevant Animal Save Movement page, not on personal accounts.
                </li>
                <li>Offer compassion and support to anyone in the group experiencing trauma or being emotionally 
                    overwhelmed at the vigil.
                </li>
                <li>Any food that is served at Animal Save Movement events such as Fundraisers, All day vigils, 
                    veg fests or any other Save events must be vegan. ASM events must be alcohol and drug free.
                </li>
                <li>Tag the relevant Animal Save Movement branch on social media posts for sharing purposes.
                </li>
                <li>Our goals are to win animal rights campaigns and build community. We take an intersectional 
                    stance and build coalitions with environmental, anti-racist, and other social justice groups.
